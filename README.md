Dependancies:
Python 3
Discord.py

How to install dependancies with pip (if you do not have pip or python the instructions are not here.
Run "pip install discord.py" in your terminal / command prompt

To start using the bot, edit the file like this: please edit the very bottom of the program
where it will say "client.run("HERE")"
Please edit the "HERE" to your discord bot token. There are many tutorials on how to make a registered
discord bot so I will not go over it here.

Once the discord bot (not the program the actual registered discord bot) is created you can add it to your
server using the invite link generator on the discord developer portal. Make sure to have all of the discord bot "intents"
enabled otherwise it will cause problems. I recommend enabling the "Administrator" setting for the permissions, remember to do this for both the bot
and the invite link. At a minimum it will just need the chat permissions, however.

Once it is running, enjoy your example bot which you can edit!

Instructions are able to be found in the file itself on how to change things. Examples are provided by default.
